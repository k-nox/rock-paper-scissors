# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This project is my first JavaScript project,
designed to fullfil the requirements for the [Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) assignment for The Odin Project.

At this time, the game is fully played in the console.
To get started, simply call game(); in the console and it will take you from there!
Eventually, I do plan to add a GUI.
