# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This project is my first JavaScript project,
designed to fullfil the requirements for the [Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) assignment for The Odin Project.

This is the first version of the game and has been preserved in this branch for records purposes.
This version is only playable in the console.
To get started, simply call game(); in the console and it will take you from there!
