# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This project is my first JavaScript project,
designed to fullfil the requirements for the [Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) assignment for The Odin Project.

The game is fully playable in the browser.
For record purposes, the console-only version of this game has been preserved in the 'terminal' branch.
